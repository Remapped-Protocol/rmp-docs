# Node Incentive Pilot v1

The Node Incentive Pilot is a limited, budgeted program intended to offset real infrastructure costs
for early node operators.

This program is an operational reimbursement mechanism.
It is not mining, not yield, and not inflationary.

## Funding source
- Infrastructure Reserve
- No minting
- No inflation

## Pilot posture
- Small by design
- Time-bounded (initially 3–6 months)
- Manual admission during pilot
- Hard budget cap per period

## Eligibility (v1)
A node operator may qualify if they:
- Operate an RMP node or protocol-supporting service
- Meet uptime targets (e.g., ≥95% per period)
- Run an approved software version
- Maintain a stable operator identity
- Are contactable for operational coordination

Token ownership is not required.

## Incentive structure
- Flat stipend per qualifying node
- Paid monthly or quarterly after verification
- Failure to meet criteria skips that period
- No retroactive clawbacks

## Controls & safety
- One payout per operator identity
- Manual review during pilot
- Program may be paused, modified, or ended without protocol changes

## Transparency
At the end of each period, aggregate metrics may be published:
- Number of participating nodes
- Total tokens distributed
- Remaining pilot budget
- Any rule changes or incidents

The pilot creates no long-term guarantees or expectations.
