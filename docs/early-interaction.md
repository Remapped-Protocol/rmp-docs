# Early Interaction with Remapped Protocol (RMP)

The Remapped Protocol network is live.

Early interaction is optional and entirely at the participant’s discretion.
There is no incentivized launch, no mining, and no token-based governance.

This page describes what early interaction means — and what it does not.

---

## What you can do

Participants may choose to:
- Connect to the public RPC endpoint
- Observe blocks and on-chain activity
- Transfer the native RMP asset
- Experiment with the network in a non-production context

Participation is voluntary.

## What you should not expect

Early interaction does not provide:
- Guaranteed access
- Special privileges
- Governance power
- Financial returns
- Priority treatment

The protocol is infrastructure, not a product offering.

## About the RMP token

The RMP token:
- Exists as part of the protocol design
- Is not required to use messaging or identity features
- Grants no governance rights
- Has no mining, staking, or yield mechanisms

The token exists solely to fund development, infrastructure, and security.

## Risk notice

Early interaction occurs before a public testnet or formal release.

Participants should assume:
- Features may change
- Interfaces may evolve
- No backwards compatibility guarantees
- No support obligations

Do not interact with funds you cannot afford to lose.
